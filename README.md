# Interest

I like to go deeper in the inner working on computer, such as Operating System, Compilers, CPU design, and more. Languages that I am currently using are C/C++, either
on Linux, Windows, MacOS or embedded. I also enjoy some Python and I'm open to look-up other languages (except JavaScript, sorry NodeJS). I'm also using VHDL for CPU
design or custom computation circuits.

The goal of Coder's Life IO is to drop knowledge in a interesting way on complex topic.
